# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find out if refactoring the code made it run more efficiently. Steve wants to have a code that can run more efficiently so he can expand the dataset. This new dataset will potentially have thousands of stocks instead of a few dozen which is why this new code is needed. 

## Results

### Analysis of the Refactored Code
These are the execution time for the 2017 and 2018 using the original code:

![ stock_analysis_2018]( https://github.com/Robeliom15/stocksanalysis/blob/main/Resources/stock_analysis_2018.png?raw=true)

These are the execution time for the new refactored code:

![ VBA_challenge_2018]( https://github.com/Robeliom15/stocksanalysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_challenge_2018.png?raw=true)
We can see that the refactored code has greatly reduced the time needed to execute the code. Additional, the 2018 year executes much faster than the 2017 year despite having the same amount of data. 

## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
